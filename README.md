## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- ScrollReveal.js
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first time I worked with Tailwind CSS. I was surprised how easy and seemless things were to learn when you already have a good basic understanding of CSS. Really, the hardest part was figuring out how to setup a project with Tailwind, which in and of itself wasn't that challenging overall. Once things were set up, it was a breeze from there.

This was also the first time I worked with ScrollReveal.js. i like the simplicity of the tool, but I was facing the issue of elements that were entering off-screen were causing the page width to increase before the animation would occur. I fixed this by making the entering elements start just onscreen, which was unfortunate because i really liked the look of the animation coming from off-screen. From my experience, it seems more limited than using the Intersection Observer API, but still has its purpose.

### Continued development

I really wanted to use React with this project, but am not comfortable enough with it yet so I stuck to HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I plan on continuing to improve my React skills and knowledge so I can feel more confident to use it on future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Official Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [An interactive and searchable Tailwind CSS cheat sheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) - This website is a great resource for those who are both new to and experienced in Tailwind CSS. You can input a CSS property and it will show you what the equivalent property is in Tailwind CSS.
